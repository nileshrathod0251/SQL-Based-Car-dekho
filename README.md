The dataset includes information about various cars, such as their year of manufacture, fuel type, and more.

Prerequisites

*Installed MySQL Workbench.
*Created a schema named "cars" and imported the "car_dekho.csv" file.

-	Verified the data from 2015 to 2023 in the excel file and imported it to the MYSQL.
-	Used the queries by using COUNT and GROUP BY to aggregate and summarize data by different attributes like year, fuel type.
-	Used SQL, aggregate queries, conditional filtering, logical operators, documenting code to analyse, summarize and visualize insights from large structured database.
-	Achieved the final output wherein the total number of cars using different fuel types and details of all the car counts were derived.
